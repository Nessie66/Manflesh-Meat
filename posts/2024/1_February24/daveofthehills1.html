    <h1>DAVE OF THE HILLS</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Greetings reader, Good Liar Mountain Buyer here.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I assume from your presence on this site that you too are interested in fascinating phenomena! Now that we are all on the same page, I am delighted to begin delving deep into figuring out this elusive figure that has long tormented and frightened, yet inspired us all!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Or maybe you just fear the fellow. Either way, we would do well to understand this creature, lest-he-lope down through the hills.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>IMAGES</h2>

        <img id="img1" src="img/dave of the hills 1/dave of the hills lying flat.jpg">
        <p>> artistic interpretation of Dave of the Hills laying by the coaxial route; a lonely 
            highwayman in emotional distress (a personality often falsely attributed to him by lonely housewives in MY opinion)
        </p>
        <img id="img2" src="img/dave of the hills 1/beddyer.jpg">
        <p>> Dave OR the devil??? three long legs or a tail??? this drove a 
            man to insanity! his last sketch of what haunted him before he died...
        </p>
        <img id="img3" src="img/dave of the hills 1/brighter.jpg">
        <p>> this snap from 2004 taken up in the abandoned hills - REAL OR FAKE? I'm going 
            to have to say real because I'm a real optimist about this stuff. 
            Although, I have my doubts as to whether this features Dave or 
            some other similarly elusive beast
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>For years Dave has been a presence in both my work and my private life. Now free of employment obligations, I am truly free to pursue him without genocidal maniacs leashing me like a dog and dragging me to wherever their interests lie. Just try to keep an open mind about this, ok??</p>
    <br>
    <p>what else is there to say really?</p>

        <h2>'Dave Marcher'</h2>
        <h3>an ancient poem of unknown origin, translated from odd rattling noises</h3>
        <br>
        <p>rat tail snail burrowing broad<br>
            our deep delving distending lord<br>
            Dave of the Hill's droning treetop hoard<br>
            reaching you from high on their hill<br>
            limping arms long and shrill<br>
            from village to village<br>
            Dave of the hills</p>
    </div>
    <p>This poems existence places his origin further back than previously thought.</p>
