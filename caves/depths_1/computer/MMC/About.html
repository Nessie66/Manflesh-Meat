            <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
            <p>Manflesh MeatCo started as a simple, honest, roadkill company. These days however, we are committed to freeing the people of this town from the horrid monogastric hill lurkers that surround us on all sides. Ridding the slopes of these pathetic things and protecting the multigastric truth is our top priority! Honestly, how can they even bare to exist!? How entitled to us they must be! Slogging around all that human flesh in their single sad stomach.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE THIS?</h1>
            <p>MMC is committed to your needs and will stop at nothing to satisfy you. MMC employs a vast range of effective techniques in order to achieve this noble goal for you. One of the most effective to date is the use of ORG's and their mulching capabilities, providing a permanent solution to the monogastric problem.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A secondary solution employed by our professionals is to simply drive them deep underground into the pits and tunnels below the hills. Specialist tools and training is required to effectively do this.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>COMPANY EXPERIENCES</h1>
            <p>MMC Ltd is committed to your needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The customer is very important, the customer will be followed by the customer. But Fringilla was flattered by football arrows. In the care of the wise man, he will pursue me, and I will be saddened by the hate of the estate. It's a fun weekend with some financing. Tomorrow's life will be promoted. It's a football truck. Until the mass itself, the port as before, the vestibule is always mass. For as my vestibule, the result of free football, I am concerned about diam. Like football.</p>

            <h1>COMPANY ROLES</h1>
            <p>There are infinite roles within MMC and the MMMOM, for example: </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Flayers (liar)</h3>
            <!-- these things hurt like a rubbertire on tarmac.. -->
            <p>Individuals tasked with the goal of driving the monogastric monsters underground with specialist tools for the job, such as the Diemiurger Scourge™. They can squirm all they want but once flayer has them in his Stainless Steel Spithood™ and Eye-Popper Patricide Pliers™, there's no fight left in them. They just go.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shit Seller Surgeons (cryer)</h3>
            <p>Nothing can control the ORG, but that wont stop shit seller from trying with all her might. Bringing it into this world was arduous enough, and they harbour a lot of resentment because of it. They cant just float freeform we have our shit sellers maintain the ORG's. (Shit sellers are all insane because who would go near that horrific, yet perfect, unnerving thing).</p>
