        <h1>CRYSTAL CAFE GIRLS</h1>
        <p>cool drawings done by people and how they see themselves and such from <a href="https://crystal.cafe">crystal.cafe </a> DO NOT GO THERE THIS IS AN FBI TRACKED LINK but cool drawings yeah yeah. I wish i sat on my bed, teeth bared. But my teeth arent sharp enough.. so what'd be the point...</p>
        <p>in one of the drawings there are labels pointing out all sorts of 'flaws' like a 'big forehead', 'broad shoulders' and a 'big ugly nose' but (in my opinion) none of these are really reflected in the actually drawing. weird she chose to specifically point these out in a self deprecating manner but not actually draw them. is she just modest or something? insecure to the point she primitively levies criticism against herself so others cant but stops short of showing these 'flaws' lest strangers on the internet see her in this way?? Maybe she just comes from a planet where everyone has tiny foreheads and tiny noses making hers huge by comparison. Who knows and/or cares. i like the art styl and the pose.</p>
        <p>I wouldnt usually rudely and arrogantly judge someone this way but these people are all from crystal cafe and therefore more than likely to be self hating terfs so who cares (yes if you are evil im allowed to wrong you, lets not have a moral debate).</p>
