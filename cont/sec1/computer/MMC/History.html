            <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>MMC was founded after 'founder' Gizmo Dryer (pictured below) dreamt of a world without roadkill</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>his mother told him  <i>"that theres my mate! yeah hes a lovely guy yeah guess what his job is. you know when animals get hit on the road at night yeah its his job to go clean them up, all the dead animals."</i> After hearing this young Gizmo was inspired, in just 20 short years he invented the tools of operation our employees use to this very day on every kind of animal from cow to otter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The company has since expanded to offer a range of services from the defeat of the leg lurker, the creation of MMMOM, the cultivation of our oil refinery girls and of course the violent war on the monogastric meat monsters that lope about the hills. The momentum is truly astounding! Where will it all go next?</p>

                <h3>The Defeat of the Leg Lurker and the Monogastric Manifesto</h3>
                <br>
                <p>GD, a life-long resident of this town has been raised, just as you have, in fear of what lopes throughout the hills around town. The thought that the only thing keeping us safe from those lurking beats reaching down to us from upon those hills is the warm light of the town. The town would not act as our protector forever reasoned GD and so the MM (Monogastric Manifesto) was created. A philosophy born from pure flesh digested and chewed and digested again as nature intended! GD resolved to rid these hills of the beastly animals barely able to digest flesh...</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first great victory came after GD led a posse of men armed with tools fashioned from scrap metal and coaxial cable to the lair of the leg lurker. The beast reared its four ugly feet and lashed out ingjuring many, GD included. But as it slunk bat into its pit a young man distinguished himself from the rest by leaping forwards and severing the head of the leg lurker with a fibre optic flash, but as the head fell he was tragically crushed deep into the earth tumbling down the pit of the leg lurkers lair, still firmly grasping at its gigantic head, never to be seen again. That man was the legendary <b>Coaxial Max</b>, may he forever rest in pits.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Coaxial Max sacrificed himself and left behind the great fibre route blazing a trail for all future remedies to the single stomached disease.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tools </h3>
                <br>
                <p>With the coaxial route now open, MMC was established and GD set to work desigining his devices and tools for operation on monogastric mutants. These proved immensely successful at driving back the hoarde of sickly slurping sluggish sad sickly beasts. The designs and operation of these devices are a closely guarded secret and can only be used by the most highly trained professionals.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Oil Refinery Girls and their uses</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As the war waged it was clear that the tools weren't enough on their own. GD, now at deaths door, crouched down on the floor and set to work experimenting, iterating. He sought out the sadness of unchanging, the impermanent cover, the residue and unclaimed. Deep underground he lead an expedition, far past the dogmatic deadLink, nearly to the potential pits themselves. Here he found the perfect multigastric specimen floating on the surface of a calm pool of water. Multi stomached yet without the cud chewing imperfections he despised in his own race. This was the MOAORG (mother of all oil refinery girls).</p>
                <br>

                    <img src="img/ManfleshMeatCo/org/DOES NOT CHEW CUD.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <p>Multigastric specimen (interferece is common around ORGs)</p>
                    <p>Multigastric without that gross cud!</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>From this GD was able to create his very own Oil Refinery Girls. He learnt to harness and control them and the acidic trails they left behind. Their uncanny ability to mulch up just about anything and digest it in full was utilised against the monogastric monsters, who the ORGs has been selectively bred to salivate at the thought of. Finally, a permanent solution to the monogastric problem.</p>
                <br>

                </div>
                
                <br>
                <p>GD, however, died before his creation was finished. Always unsatisified with it he sought true multigastric perfection. Something that could fly away forever and be untouchable.</p>
