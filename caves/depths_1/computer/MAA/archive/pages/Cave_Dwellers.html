                    <p>It's no secret that Manflesh MeatCo drove the majority of the monogastric underground, leaving the hills barren and boring. But even before then, the caves below the hills were known to be inhabited by many different monogastric creatures.</p>
                    <p>These creatures, while mostly unremarkable, make up a large portion of the monogastric population and have been fairly well documented due to their tendency to just sit around.</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>The underground has been inhabited by monogastric monsters for over 10,000 years. Our first glimpse into this underground society comes from this period, in the form of cave paintings and engravings found both above and below ground. This is evidence of a possible short-lived co-habitation of the monogastric and multigastric, although evidence shows that soon after monogastric creatures appeared underground the human population vacated the caves, opting to live above ground instead.</p>
                    <p>Cave dwelling creatures are of particular interest as they are thought to be some of the first monogastric creatures to have appeared, and the caves they inhabit likely hold the answer to the monogastric mystery...</p>
                    <p>Sightings have been common throughout time.<br>Most monogastric photography is of cave dwellers:</p>
