        <h1>CRYSTAL CAFE GIRLS</h1>
        <p>Cool drawings and the ways you can see how these people see 
            themselves competing with how they want to be seen by others 
            (in some).</p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="c2" class="content">
        <p>in image () there are labels pointing out supposed flaws such as 
            a 'big forehead', 'broad shoulders' and a 'big ugly nose'. 
            However, arguably, none of these are depicted in the drawing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>its like the artist is insecure enough to levy these insults 
            against herself while also being insecure beyond this to the 
            point that she is unable to actually depict these 'negative' 
            traits in a drawing. She is able to completely control how these 
            people perceive her and chooses to depict herself more how she 
            wants to be seen, what a dream! But she must also still 
            preemptively point out what she believes to be flaws, despite 
            the chance of anyone on this anonymous imageboard 
            knowing/discovering how she really looks being very slim. 
            SO why did she still chose to criticize herself!? is she being 
            modest!? is the image only how she wishes she looked!? insecurity 
            insecutirty insecwirityye!?! who knows and/or cares! i just like 
            the artstyle and pose really. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I would usually feel guilty arrogantly judging someone in this way 
            but these people are crystal cafe dwellers, and therefore all 
            likely to be self hating terfs. i wonder what role self hatred 
            and internalised misogyny plays in becoming a terf, probably the 
            same role it plays in adopting any kind of hatred for people. 
            (A BIG ONE AMONG MANY OTHER COMPLICATED FACTORS, LIKE BEING A 
            BIG OL BORING LOSER) anyway heres more</p>
