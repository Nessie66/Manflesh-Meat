        <p>
            my heart is a plastic ball with a smaller ball inside and when you shake me I make a rattling noise,<br>
            my arms and legs are easily bendable,<br>
            but my head pops off if you pull too hard.<br>
            and then I start flailing about.<br>
            and sometimes its hard to resist screaming loud noises in peoples faces<br>
            just to get them to shut up<br>
            and to spin around and explode<br>
            then go back to whatever it was you weren't doing.
