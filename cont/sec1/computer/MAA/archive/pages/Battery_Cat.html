                    <p>Battery Cat is the name given to a fairly well known monogastric monster often seen by townsfolk moping about. Known for its sour mood and tendency to wallow in self pity, some have developed empathetic feelings for Battery Cat whereas others see it as despicable. It often appears curled up rocking back and forth sitting on rocks or in hedges, presumably after having fallen in and refusing to pick itself back up. It doesn't cry or wail like many others do but instead sits deathly still with its head in its hands.</p>
                    <p>MMC left Battery Cat alone, feeling too sorry for the creature to really do anything about it, and it was presumed harmless anyway.</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>As with most monogastric creatures sightings these days are extremely rare, in fact Battery Cat hasn't been seen since 2004 and many now believe that it simply walked itself underground of its own accord where it probably still resides in some deep chasm, drowning in it's own self made mythology.</p>
                    <p>Not much documentation exists on Battery Cat and so it's thought to be relatively new, with it first being mentioned in the 50s and then spotted by hikers in the late 80s. Despite this it has managed to maintain a modest presence within art and literature, mainly due to its pitiful characteristics.</p>

                    <p>Completely harmless, approach at will, maybe pat its shoulder or something and say 'there, there'.</p>
