            <p>
                if i could be whacked in the head with a big bat<br>
                it's all i need i would be fixed after that<br>
                <br>
                grab my face and give me a purpose<br>
                then smack my face off a hard tile surface<br>
                <br>
                if only they'd pin me to the ground<br>
                and drill open my brain with a corkscrew<br>
                screeching metal biting bone resounding<br>
                twisting my thoughts until i'm anew<br>
                <br>
                just thrust my hand as fast as you can off of<br>
                a metal pole and stick my head out <br>
                of a car window and dangle me down - drown <br>
                me in my blood and bury me <br>
                where i won't ever be found <br>
                <br>
                stick your thumbs in my eyes  <br>
                pop my eyes, <br>
                and shove each hand in a socket<br>
                <br>
                reach in and grab my brain and tear it apart <br>
                and scrape my skull from the inside with your nails<br>
                <br>
                then split the whole thing in half and scream in my face<br>
            </p>
