I forsee torture trouble in your future
You remind me of one of my favorite stories <br> about quality control
Dude, you're the wrong end of the stick
You look like metal rebar sticking out of concrete
Nothing you do is gonna stop your face from melting off
I think it's time you give eating people a shot
You never should've come above ground, bad move
What you seek will be in the next layby pull over
A bald pedo will break into your car
You're about to grow horns, so be prepared for that
You will fall in love in 100 years or so
its coming around it goes around it comes around <br> and round it goes around <br> around around around round <br> around and round and round and round and
theres a bliss laid out before you <br> if you like it like that kind of stuff
all you seem to do is absorb everyone around you <br> you're a blob person
you need to change your name to GIZMO right now!
everythings kind of about you but its kind of about me
their parade will never pass your way
