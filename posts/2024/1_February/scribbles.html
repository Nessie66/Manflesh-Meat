        <h1>Scribbles (What a disgrace oh the humanity!)</h1>
        <p>in a blog from 2007 <a href="https://illustrationart.blogspot.com/2007/12/in-exchange-with-readers-after-my-last.html">HERE</a> a man called David is angry that the museum of modern art features a lot of 'unmitigated crap' and 'crummy drawings' and these are the examples he chose</p>

        <p>also he invents some narrative about MOMA having a bias against disney because they preserve 'lame' immitations but turn their noses up at his original work (apparently)</p>
        <br>
        <p>anyway i like these drawings no need to defend them they are clearly awesome you know it i know it Yoshitomo Nara could create mickey mouse but Walt Disney could never make GUITAR WOLF!!!!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also there is a funny guy in the comments crying about going to art school and having everything he liked in art "put down and laughed at" :'(</p>
