                    <p>I was a core collaborator on the ORG project back in the 90s, but that doesn't mean I understand these things anymore than you do. Intended as an engineered multigastric sort of perfect device-being, they sure are fucking weird! I guess they're what you get when you pour your resentment into conjuring up a being.</p>
                    <h3 class="s1">Description</h3>
                    <p>I'd rather not. <br><br>
                        They don't eat hay bales.<br>
                        They leave their acid trails.<br>
                        They smell stale.<br>
                        and they are all pretty frail.</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>Derived from the MOAORG and developed in the Skunkworks, MMC made 3 of these things and for a long time was able to psionically control them with their professional (and usually unwilling) SSScs. Nothing about it was moral or right but they were infinitely valuable for their ability to digest the indigestible monogastric monsters that were previously going to landfill. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The MOAORG was discovered deep underground during the 1997 caves expedition between the dogmatic deadLink and the potential pits. They stole it away and used it to grown their own Oil Refinery Girls. The main aim was really just to stop the "gross" chewing of cud but it clearly went further than that didn't it!</p>
                    <p>Creating these things was a painstaking process that cost a lot of flesh and blood. A lot of failiures were endured and it totally wasn't worth it in the end.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Currently all 3 are unaccounted for after the 2005 incident at MMC-Skunkworks and are believed to have descended down underground in search of monogastric meat.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to stay away if you see one, these things are no joke they will melt you and slurp up your acidic sloppy flesh. Not fun! Also they give me the creeps.</p>
