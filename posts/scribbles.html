        <h1>Scribbles (What a disgrace oh the humanity!)</h1>
        <p>blog from 2007 <a href="https://illustrationart.blogspot.com/2007/12/in-exchange-with-readers-after-my-last.html">here</a>
        david is angry that the museum of modern art features a lot of "unmitigated crap"
        and "crummy drawings" and these are some of the drawings he chose as examples</p>

        <p>he starts inventing some narrative about MOMA having something against
            disney because they preserve "lame" immitations yet turn their noses up
            at his original work apparently, some very weird ideas dave about what art "deserves"
            to be preserved or not. also some guy in the comments crying about going to art school and
            having everything he liked in art "put down and laughed at" :'( 
        </p>
        <p>pretty funny also from 2007 which is like 20 years ago so whatever,
            i wont defend these drawings they are quite clearly awesome you know it
            i know it. Yoshitomo Nara could create mickey mouse but Walt Disney could
            never make GUITAR WOLF!!!
