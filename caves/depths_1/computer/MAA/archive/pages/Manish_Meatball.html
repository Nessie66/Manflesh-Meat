                    <p>Manish Meatball goes by many names, prince of the fresh flesh, pariah of flabby gumskin, master of all meat... None of these are accurate in describing the hills gross guiltless lousy gangster of the underground. With a bulbous flesh wrapped head and sly slimy thin gangly limbs, he more resembles a sickly bear than a 'prince'.</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>A trickster and con artist always trying to one over humble townsfolk commuting through the hills, Manish Meatball has amassed quite a reputation. He first appears in the early 20th century and quickly gets to work conning whoever he can slither up behind. He even managed to place a few ads in the town paper before he was well know enough to be stopped, god knows how he managed it. Ultimately, nobody has fallen for his tricks for decades and it's a sorry sight to see him wither and wander throughout the woods, still thinking he's a master of manipulation.</p>

                    <p>He at the very least was able to effectively avoid the MMC patrols and has been sighted as recently as last year slinking about.</p>
                    <p>Notably, he is actually convinced that he's human and has been stopped from entering town many times. This makes him unique in that no other monogastric monster would ever dare come that close. Very quickly the unnatural light begins to melt his flesh and he flees on all fours back into the wilds, usually being chased by an ORG or an angry mob. In fact this may be what caused him to have a melting mass of flesh for a head. Still, despite all this, he has become quite the popular character with many seeing whimsy in his antics, or just taking pity on him. Anyway, last I heard he was trying to form a band.</p>
