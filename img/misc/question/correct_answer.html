            <p>The main problem is creating a ghost. Because to become a ghost it is said you have to die with some sort of unfinished business in the mortal realm, and it is debatable if zombies or vampires can truly die in the same way a human does, as they are already technically dead. So if you become a ghost before you become a vampire, you then need to find a vampire ghost to transform you which could be tricky.</p>
            <p>The solution I have come up with is: Werewolf --> Vampire --> Zombie --> Ghost</p>
            <p>Werewolf first, because I feel that you need to be alive to be infected with lycanthropy. It just wouldn't work on a vampire, because they have no blood - or a zombie, because they are too dead for disease. It wouldn't work on a ghost for obvious reasons. Of course there is the possibility that the lycanthropy is a curse of some kind rather than a medical condition but let's not get into that. After this they will be turned into a vampire, then resurrected as a zombie . This, I believe, makes this werewolf zombie vampire technically alive at ths point, if only in the 'living-dead' sense. Finally, you can kill them (granted they never finished a book or left the oven on or something) creating a werewolf vampire zombie ghost!</p>
            <p>Congratulations on getting the right answer, although I doubt you got there by the same process as I did.</p>
