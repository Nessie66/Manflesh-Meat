                    <p>Frail Tuberculady Circus Riders (Tubercular Lady) is the designation given to a group of entities that were once a common sight, far in the distance. They usually appear to float far above the ground, sometimes with overlong limbs snaking their way back down to the surface. They have a wide array of variations, although it is unknown if these visual differences are consequential.</p>
                    <p>Approaching the entities at any time, from any direction is extremely difficult as they often behave much 'like a rainbow' - always in the distance no matter how close you get. There have, however, been isolated reports of individuals finding these creatures right above their homes at night in more rural areas (although this has never been verified).</p>

                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>Of all the monogastric organisms Tubercular Ladies are thought to be some of the oldest. There is evidence of these beings dating all the way back to 8000-7000 BC in the form of human artwork such as in the Hoof Bat Caves cave paintings. These creatures have persisted all throughout monogastric history and yet largely remain a mystery to experts. </p>
                    <p>FTCR monitoring stations were implemented during the 1990s by MMC in order to track these creatures. They were part of an initiative to target the creatures directly, however it proved ineffective as MMC operatives could never get close to them no matter how early they had been detected. These monitoring stations did however provide us with our first clear photo of a FTCR.</p>

                    <p>These creatures, while never directly affected by the MMC, slowly started to disappear as more monogastric monsters were driven underground or devoured. They are a very rare sight in the modern day.</p>
                    <p>Some who dare to live further out into the hills, in their isolated cabins and communities, have claimed to have been 'visited' by one of these things. Supposedly it's seen as a sort of test of character with the visitee enjoying a string of good luck if they are worthy. If not, their house may be found empty the next day, inexplicably drenched in a metalic orangey-red fluid of an unknown origin.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>These creatures have fully entrenched themselves within the public imagination, becoming a figurehead for all that is monogastric and a common feature of folklore and fairy tales. Often touted as both enigmatic, yet benovolent beings and vicious, ill understood, manflesh eating monsters.<br><br> Here you can see a childs drawing of a creature they allegedly saw crawling through the undergrowth - a key thing to note is that it is depicted with a nose which is inaccurate from what we know. The child was likely inspired by a bedtime story demonstrating these creatures firm place in our traditions. </p>
                    <h3>Procedure Report</h3>
                    <p>Unlikely to come across in the wild, still best advised to steer clear as it is unknown what these creatures can inflict upon a human being like you or me.</p>
