        <p>Jason Molina was a musician mainly active throughout the
            late 90s/early2000s. He's released a lot of music under many different
            names with a revolving cast of talented musicians, but his most well 
            known material was released as Songs:Ohia (later renamed to Magnolia Electric Co).

        <p>I don't know the full details of Jason's personal life so I won't go into
            it too much, but he struggled with alcoholism for most of the decade after
            2003 which led to him cancelling tours in 2009 and eventually dying of
            multiple organ failiure on March 16th, 2013 at 39 - supposedly with nothing
            but a cell phone in his pocket with only his grandmother's number on it.</p>

        <h3>Magnolia Electric Co.</h3>
        <img id="img3" src="img/itll_get_so_quiet_when_this_record_ends/Magnolia Electric Co..jpg">
        <p>In 2003 Songs:Ohia released (the) Magnolia Electric Co. which is one of my
            favorite albums ever, I love it dearly it means a lot to me. 
            It's not like a lot of the other music I listen
            to, being a sort of alternative country/indie rock album.
            It's a really huge sounding record with a full  
            band behind it but despite this it manages to be very personal, with Jason staying 
            firmly at the center of it all. His powerful lyricism and dynamic vocals manage 
            to make it feel incredibly intimate and impactful.</p>

        <p>I'm dont understand the common sentiment "I like all music except country". Maybe it's
            different for americans growing up around that sort of music, but
            I've personally never had a problem with it (not that I would
            consider myself a massive country music fan). I think this
            album is a perfect example of how the sounds of country music like slide
            guitars, slapback delay, chord organs and twangy country vocals can be 
            incredibly emotional and create a familiar yet tragic atmosphere when used
            right. After initially hearing this record I was compelled to go out and
            buy a glass slide, which I broke and cut my foot on.
        </p>
        <h3>Songs</h3>
        <p>Every song on this is great so its hard to single out any but I did
            it anyway for convenience.
        </p>
        <h4>Farewell Transmission</h4>
        <p>Probably Songs:Ohia's most well known song. It opens with a relaxing and laidback (but iconic)
            guitar riff with a restrained drumline plodding alongside it. But just as
            you think you know what you're in for the song suddenly opens up. It feels like it has a lot of momentum to it, which I love in a song. The next 7 minutes feel like
            you're going on a sort of journey which culminates in one of my favorite song closings
            ever. Also the slide guitar all over is amazing.
        </p>
        <h4>Just Be Simple</h4>
        <p>One of the more country sounding songs on this album (see The Old Black Hen).
            The lyricism on this one is some of my favorite on the entire album. The song feels
            resigned, like the feeling of relapsing back into a bad habit or giving up on something. It ends with Jason's pleas for
            life to "Just be simple again" followed by a heartwrenching slide guitar.
        </p>
        <h4>Almost Was Good Enough</h4>
        <p>One of the louder songs on the album, it has these two overdriven twangy guitars
            creating an energised atmosphere on either side of you while an organ of some kind pulls you
            along. It's hard to explain what makes this song so impactful but Jasons wails of
            "Almost no one makes it out" make it feel very tragic and genuine.
        </p>
        <h4>Hold On Magnolia</h4>
        <p>Easily the most hearbreaking song on the album. It's a slow and grim ballad drenched in an atmosphere of surrender and it
            really pulls you under. The song briefly rises up at the end only to settle back down as if its accepting its fate or something.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite song is probably The Big Game is Every Night. Though technically a bonus track, it sort 
            of feels like the antithesis to Farewell Transmission - the fairly upbeat song that opened the album.
            It's quite long at 9 minutes, but like most of the tracks on the album it really sucks you into it.
            It feels grand, like Farewell Transmission, but in a dark and oppressive way and this is reflected in the
            lyrics.

            <h4>Jason Molina was a fantastic lyricist and here are some of my favorites from this album.</h4>
            <br>
            <p>I will resurrect it, I'll have a good go at it<br>
                I'll streak his blood across my beak<br>
                Dust my feathers with his ash<br>
                I can feel his ghost breathing down my back<br>
                <br>
                (Farewell Transmission)
            </p>

            <p>You'll never hear me talk about one day getting out<br>
                Why put a new address on the same old loneliness<br>
                <br>
                And everything you hated me for…<br>
                Honey, there was so much more<br>
                I just didn't get busted<br>
                <br>
                (Just Be Simple)
            </p>

            <p>It'll get so quiet when this record ends<br>
                You can hear the first hour of the world<br>
                You can hear the willow branches touch the wave<br>
                Write our names beside our darlings hearts<br>
                <br>
                I am the snake, they're all saying<br>
                If they look up here, do they see just my black tail swaying?<br>
                If I'm all fangs, and all lies, and all poison<br>
                If I'm really what they're saying<br>
                I don't want to disappoint them<br>
                <br>
                (The Big Game is Every Night)</p>
