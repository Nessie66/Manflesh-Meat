        <h1>Scribbles (What a disgrace oh the humanity!)</h1>
        <p>blog from 2007 <a href="https://illustrationart.blogspot.com/2007/12/in-exchange-with-readers-after-my-last.html">here</a>. guy called david is angry that the museum of modern art features a lot of "unmitigated crap" and "crummy drawings" and these are some he chose as examples</p>

        <p>basically he just goes on inventing some narrative about MOMA having a bias against disney because they preserve other peoples "lame" imitations yet turn their noses up at his original work (apparently). just weird ideas about what art "deserves" to be preserved or not. why am i upset at a blog from 2007 that was like centuries davids probably dead by no- IM MAD BECAUSE HE CAME AFTER GUITAR WOLF!!! Also theres a funny guy in the comments crying about going to art school and having everything he liked in art "put down and laughed at" :'(</p>
        <p>i wont defend these drawings they are quite clearly awesome you know it i know it. Yoshitomo Nara could create mickey mouse but Walt Disney could never make GUITAR WOLF!!!</p>
