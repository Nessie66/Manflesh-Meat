                    <p>Button Presser Knob Turner is the revered radiant revitalizing religious figure in the form of a bearwolf (anthill annoyer). The cult of the Wild and Wooly would follow this thing to the ends of our earth, and many have - leaving the town, never to return. </p>
                    <p>His majestic bearwolf form (a multigastric image) has meant that this creature has evaded all the prejudice that other monogastric lifeforms have not. His followers actually deny his monogastricity, claiming him to be a multigastric martyr. Proof that the multigastric exists in the hills. This however, is false. There is no evidence to suggest that he is multigastric whereas there is all the evidence of monogastricity - no acid trail, big innocent eyes, an unclear diet, general moping around and stuff.</p>

                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>First sightings date back to the 1950s when he started to appear in iconography around town. He was noted for his wise and melancholic appearance and many latched onto his image. In 1968, town-member Maelgwn - brother to Vortigern -  met the beast on one of his hilltop pursuits of knowledge. He claims to have had a life-changing conversation, a conversation which ended up being the basis for the Wild and Wooly which he formed as soon as he returned. Vortigern has always been in vocal opposition of this, saying he lost his brother that day or something lalala whatever but now what we are left with are several of his 'teachings':</p>

                    <p>The main focus of the W&W is to become meaningless and to never thing of anything ever again as things are just easier like that. I've sure been there! Turns out time never stops and you just keep getting fed it, can't blame them if they need a chance to swallow! eh!</p>
                    <p>There are many differing accounts of the conversation Maelgwn had with BPKT, one of the most famous quotes is his famous line "I went to the school of pushing buttons where I got a degree in turning knobs." This is where he gets his name and what he meant by this is really anyone's guess. Really- lots of people like to harp on about this.</p>
                    <p>A common theme here but this character has not been seen for quite some time, although his last sightings were in the 70s and so unlikely to have anything to do with the MMC. His following, however, has only grown in his absence, peaking in the 1990s.</p>
