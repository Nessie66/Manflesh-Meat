                    <h3 class="s1">Description</h3>
                    <p>Dave of the Hills is an enigmatic and mysterious figure that has long tormented and fascinated mankind.</p>
                    <p>The reality of Dave is a mysterious one. No concrete visual exists for this creature, as he has proved extremely difficult to photograph or even describe. He has been said by some to have 3 or even 4 legs that stretch far beyond the horizon, or to have a long forked tail that he drags along the ground. Some claim he has no face at all while other say he has a row of gnashing sharp teeth. Some even claim he resembles a tall and handsome man who seduces young women and steals them away forever.</p>
                    <p>There is no consensus on the figure but it is generally believed that he is a real creature that has escaped MMC's grasp - but little concrete evidence of this has been found. The most common evidence comes in the form of personal allegory, as Dave sightings have commonly taken place on or around the Coaxial Route and all throughout the hills starting in the early 1900s.</p>

                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>First appearing in local legends early in the 20th century, and then later in written stories such as "The Tales of Dave, Highwayman" in 1913 and "The capture of a Devil" from 1923, Dave has taken on an alternate life as a literary figure of legend. He is often depicted as a good natured, yet dastardly rogue or a tragic long suffering hero of sorts.</p> 
                    <p>Early witness accounts of him have been mostly lost or twisted by time, modern sightings usually happen late in the day around sunset, when visibility is low, and so far nobody has been able to provide a consistent physical description, despite these numerous sightings.</p>
                    <p>In 1973 Vortigern (the leading expert on DOTH) created his famous artistic interpretation of the creature. While certainly not the first nor the last time he has appeared in art form, this depiction has gone on to become the most popular and has been widely used in everything from book covers to album covers.</p>
                    <p>During the 90s MMC was consistently sabotaged on the Coaxial Route by a gang of monogastric monsters, usually assumed to be Dave and his Treetop Hoard. These attacks ceased shortly after the ORGs started to be used  more widely in 1999.</p>

                    <p>DOTH is of great personal interest to me. I have continued Vortigerns work in studying and documenting this mysterious beast and I still firmly believe him to be out there among the hills. Although sightings are uncommon these days.</p>
