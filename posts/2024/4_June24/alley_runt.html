        ME IN THE ASCETIC LIFE<br>
        (hard being a steamrolling machine on the dating scene)<br>
        <br>
        you know what they all say<br>
        <br>
        screech of the skeleton tree -<br>
        hard being a steamrolling machine on the dating scene<br>
        <br>
        in the clouds a butterfly face<br>
        two stars smiled and winked at me<br>
        my levels of pattern recognition are intense like this<br>
        <br>
        you could show me a blank piece of paper <br>
        and if i stared at it long enough id see a distance<br>
        or a face, or a spider, or a person reaching for me<br>
        but stealing their hand away as i grasp back<br>
        <br>
        honestly, stop looking over our shambling destruction<br>
        you're kind of stomping down a flat thing<br>
        and i dont even know what comes after dust<br>
        <br>
        your parade will not pass my way.<br>
        and now i know how rotted my heart is.<br>
        i can better do nothing about it.
        </p>
