    <h1>DAVE OF THE HILLS</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Greetings reader, Good Liar Mountain Buyer here.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I assume from your presence on this site that you too are interested in fascinating phenomena! Now that we are all on the same page, I am delighted to delve deep into figuring out this elusive figure that has long tormented yet inspired us all!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Or maybe you just fear him.. Either way, we would do well to understand this figure, lest he lope down through the hills.</p>

        <img id="img1" src="img/dave of the hills 1/dave of the hills lying flat.jpg">
        <p>> artistic interpretation of him by the coaxia route; a lonely 
            highwayman in emotional distress (a personality often falsely attributed to him by lonely housewives in MY opinion)
        </p>
        <img id="img2" src="img/dave of the hills 1/beddyer.jpg">
        <p>> Dave OR the devil???? three long legs or a tail?!?? this drove a 
            man to insanity! his last sketch of what haunted im before he died...
        </p>
        <img id="img3" src="img/dave of the hills 1/brighter.jpg">
        <p>> this snap from 2004 taken up in the hills, REAL OR FAKE?? im going 
            to have to say real because im a real optimist about this stuff, 
            although i have my doubts as to whether this depicts Dave or 
            another elusive beast
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>for years Dave has been a presence in both my work and my private life, now free of employment obligations i am truly free to pursue this without genocidal maniacs leashing me and dragging to wherever their interests lie. just try to keep an open mind about this ok??</p>
    <br>
    <p>what else is there to say really?</p>

        <h2>'Dave Marcher'</h2>
        <h3>an ancient poem of unknown origin, translated from odd rattling noises</h3>
        <br>
        <p>rat tail snail burrowing broad<br>
            our deep delving distending lord<br>
            Dave of the Hill's droning treetop hoard<br>
            reaching you from high on their hill<br>
            limping arms long and shrill<br>
            from village to village<br>
            Dave of the hills</p>
