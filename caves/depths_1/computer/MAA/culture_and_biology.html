            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <hr class="hrB">
            <p>Very little is known about monogastric culture, thanks again to the "professionals" for not bothering to ask. It's not even been established that there is a shared culture of any kind. </p>
            <p>I have rarely been able to observe them in a natural environment and when I have they only seem to stand in place, looking sort of disappointed really.</p>
            <p>Some of the old folks in town say they can talk and even claim to have had full conversations with them! I can only dream of having such an opportunity. Now days any stragglers left in the hills flee at the sight of you. Although sometimes they spin around and scream at the top of their lungs (if they have lungs). That's something I suppose.</p> 
            <hr class="hrA">
            <h2>Diet/Biology</h2>
            <hr class="hrA">
            <p>Their famously uncanny human appearance does nothing to clue us into how these things live. It's a commonly held belief that they feast on the flesh of man, an unproven stereotype brought on by the correlation between people going missing and the number of sightings.</p>
            <p>I don't necessarily discount this rumour entirely, we've all come across a desecrated pile of what could only be man guts lying by the side of the coaxial route, but I still don't think its too wise to jump to conclusions.</p>
            <hr class="hrA">
            <h2>The Infinite and Chickens</h2>
            <hr class="hrA">
            <p>The infinite is a recurring theme, often mentioned in passing by many a man who has gone mad after straying too far from the coaxial route on a routine round (had a few too many eh?)</p>
            <p>What we do know is it seems to relate to their overlong features and its an opt-in sort of process, also that it has something to do with #chickens'. Whatever that is.</p>
            <p>More research into this is needed, but it's difficult finding people passionate about this sort of stuff.</p>
