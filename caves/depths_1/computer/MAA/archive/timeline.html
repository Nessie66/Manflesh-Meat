            <h3>5 billion years ago</h3>
            <p>The hills are very different... there is no town, there aren't even hills yet.</p>
            <h3>1-2 billion years ago</h3>
            <p>At some point in this time range it is believed the hills themselves were formed, either through forces beyond our comprehension, or just some geographical tectonic stuff or whatever.</p>
            <h3>400 million years ago</h3>
            <p>Apparently this is when the tectonic plates smashed into each other, this probably had an effect on the world and therefore the hills but it's beyond the scope of this fake website.</p>
            <h3>300 million years ago</h3>
            <p>Speleogenesis occurs and the caves beneath the hills begin to develop. The rising and falling of the water table and the minerals contained within create natural ground voids of dissolved rock. </p>
            <h3>230 - 65 million years ago</h3>
            <p>Dinosaurs.</p>
            <h3>Skipping over a bit...</h3>
            <h3>15,000 years ago</h3>
            <p>Palaeolithic settlers first inhabit the hills and the vast network of caves beneath them, leaving behind an assortment of sharp stone implements.</p>
            <h3>10,000 years ago</h3>
            <p>Roughly believed to be when the potential pits were first reached by humans, coincides with the first evidence of monogastric creatures in artwork - Several cave paintings/engravings from this era can be found, both above and below ground. Underground inhabitation abruptly stops at some point during this period.</p>
            <h3>5000 years ago</h3>
            <p>First evidence of neolithic farmers clearing the great forests that once covered the hills. Still evidence of underground burial tombs within the caves, along with stone monoliths and stone circles above ground.</p>
            <h3>3000 years ago</h3>
            <p>Generally regarded as the era in which our town was established. Technological advancements and flourishing industry herald an age of progress!</p>
            <h3>2000 years ago </h3>
            <p>In the year 568 BC 'Rus Runk', a local legend, supposedly drove back a "great and ugly beast with multiple vicious poison spitting heads". The beast attacked as Rus travelled into town early one morning and he was only able to drive the beast back with help from his horse (rearing, spitting, kicking, biting). Likely the first human encounter with the Leg Lurker.</p>
            <h3>1000 years ago (1098 AC)</h3>
            <p>First documented sightings of the monogastric creatures, originally referred to as 'face-eaters'. Potential genesis of the traditional flesh eating figures that have haunted peoples dreams ever since...</p>
            <h3>1742</h3>
            <p>RMPR (Registry for Missing Persons Report) established.</p>
            <h3>1868</h3>
            <p>First documented capture of a "monogastric entity" found sneaking around a barn on the edge of town. First documented use of the term "monogastric" after the specimen was cut open and what they found was lackluster. Sightings increase in number from this point on, as do disappearances.</p>
            <h3>1897 </h3>
            <p>Monogastric population explodes, recorded sightings exceed 100 and the creatures enter the public consciousness as a permanent nuisance. Venturing out into the hills is no longer deemed safe.</p>
            <h3>1903</h3>
            <p>First official survey of the hills conducted since the 1700s, a crew of 14 set out. Only 4 return. According to the RMPR, vanishing cases reach 1000 (since 1742).</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Some assorted sightings:</h3>
            <h4>1912 </h4>
            <!-- OR WhATEVER IT WAS! -->
            <p>The village times reported a sighting of "a fish or whatever it was".</p>
            <h4>1932</h4>
            <p>Miss K Dillinger reported seeing a "long limbed man" stalking through the treeline just north of town.</p>
            <h4>1956</h4>
            <p>George Henrys told the village council he'd "been scared 2/5ths to death!" by a small creature described as "a human childs head on legs" that fled his outhouse early one morning and chased him into a field.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1984</h3>
            <p>MMC established.</p>
            <h3>1992</h3>
            <p>Gizmo Dyer and his posse take up arms against the Leg Lurker, driving it underground. Thus begins the manflesh reign of terror.</p>
            <h3>1997</h3>
            <p>Gizmo Dyer leads his infamous expedition deep underground, the first in hundreds of years, where his is able to find the MOAORG.</p>
            <h3>2000</h3>
            <p>MMMOM created and monogastric creatures begin to be driven down underground or mulched up at a staggering rate.</p>
            <h3>2004</h3>
            <p>I part ways with the MMC</p>
            <h3>June 28th 2005</h3>
            <p>Incident at MMC-Skunkworks results in the disastrous loss of 32 lives and escape of the ORGs along with potentially other dangerous things. GD falls ill and dies shortly after.</p>
            <h3>December 28th 2008</h3>
            <p>The hills officially declared safe as all (most) monogastric creatures are reported to have "either been mulched up or driven down". </p>
            <h3>January 1st 2009</h3>
            <p>MMC officially dissolved</p>
