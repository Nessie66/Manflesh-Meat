            <p>The main problem is the ghost because to become a ghost you have to die with some sort of unfinished mortal business and it's debatable if zombies/vampires can even die as they are already technically dead. So if you become a ghost before you become a vampire you then need to find a vampire ghost to transform you which could be impossible!</p>
            <p>I've done some research and while it seems to be rare... it is possible that a vampire can become a ghost whereas a zombie cannot as they are quite literally dead. But now we run into the same issue because if you go say Werewolf --> Vampire --> Ghost, how do you make a zombie ghost?</p>
            <p>The solution I came up with is Werewolf --> Zombie --> Vampire --> Ghost</p>
            <p>Werewolf first because I feel that you need to be alive to be infected with lycanthropy and it just wouldn't work on a vampire because they have no blood or a zombie because they are dead (it wouldn't work on a ghost for obvious reasons). Of course there is the possibility that the lycanthropy is a curse of some kind rather than a condition but let's not get into that... After this you will be transformed into a vampire effectively killing you, and then as a zombie which make sense as zombies can be created from resurrecting the dead which I think technically makes this werewolf vampire zombie 'alive', if only in the 'living-dead' sense. Finally, you can kill them (granted they never finished a book or left the oven on or something) creating a werewolf vampire zombie ghost!</p>
            <p>Anyway congratuations for getting the right answer!</p>
