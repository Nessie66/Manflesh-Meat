            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr class="hrB">
            <p>Greetings, my name is Big Liar Mountain Buyer. But you can call me BiarMuyerMountainLiar. Born before you, I, like my forebears for countless generations, have lived all my life in this small village. (Or it used to be a village anyway.) <a href="finnant.html">This</a> is my house.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Im unmarried, my un-marriage hails from 16 miles east where all my unlikeable characteristics and disgusting habits watch with binoculars (rotten on the inside rotten on the outside, no?). I'm horribly ugly it's true, I'm horribly insecure. Now that I've preemptively levied this critisism against myself you can't be unattracted to me. You just can't ok! For more information go <a href="my_own_mythology.html">here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I used to work for the MMC but those years are behind me. Couldn't hack the gallows so to speak, needed something to chew on. My research was stifled by those lunatics. A real breakup with no makeup, glad I got out of there before it all went to shit.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Anyways here are a few of my favorite physics jokes:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>student - "what is spin?"<br>
                teacher - "Imagine a ball that spinning except its not a ball and its not spinning"</p>
            <br>
            <p>A physicist, an engineer, and a statistician are hunting a<br>
                deer. They see it in the distance. The physicist calculates a<br>
                parabolic trajectory, pulls back the bowstring the calculated<br>
                amount and fires. The arrow lands 10 feet short. The<br>
                engineer adds in a fudge factor for air resistance, pulls<br>
                back the bowstring and fires. The arrow lands 10 feet long<br>
                The statistician yells "we got him!"</p>
            <br>
            <p>reading a book absout glue.. i cant put its down
                i cant put rhe book down</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Sorry about this I've just got this new disease, I'm trying to spread it around as much as possible just bear with me.</p>
