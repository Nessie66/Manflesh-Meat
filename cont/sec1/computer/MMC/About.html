            <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>MMC was founded after 'founder' Gizmo Dryer (pictured below) dreamt of a world without roadkill</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/ManfleshMeatCo/mmm/GD.jpg">
            <br>
            <p>his mother told him  <i>"that theres my mate! yeah hes a lovely guy yeah guess what his job is. you know when animals get hit on the road at night yeah its his job to go clean them up, all the dead animals."</i> After hearing this young Gizmo was inspired, in just 20 short years he invented the tools of operation our employees use to this very day on every kind of animal from cow to otter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The company has since expanded to offer a range of services from the defeat of the leg lurker, the creation of MMMOM, the cultivation of our oil refinery girls and of course the violent war on the monogastric meat monsters that lope about the hills. The momentum is truly astounding! Where will it all go next?</p>
