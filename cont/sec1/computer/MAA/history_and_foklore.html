            <p>The history of the hills is ill understood, no thanks to those lunatics running around with surgical equipment. And to think I once believed in them.</p>
            <p>I can't speak much to the geographical formation, hill are hills i s'pose, but there are many monoliths dotting them. Some of these seem to depict monogastric things in much the same way we know them today.</p>
            <p>These drawings mostly provide us with more questions than they answer though; how long do they live? have they been wandering around forever (wandering. thats withering! thats not wandering its withering) and most importantly, whats the infinite?</p>
            <p>Many other strange things have been found up and around there, though we would need to venture much further in order to find anything truly astounding.</p>
            <img width="0" height="0" src="">
            <p>Strange trees dot the skyline, rising up out of the hills and bending in all sorts of unnatural directions. Perhaps these are important somehow?</p>

            <h2>Folklore</h2>
            <hr class="hrA">
            <p>Obviously the hill lurkers feature prominently in our human folklore. From heroes with a dark side to mighty beasts and ancient evils, the multigastric imagination is forever haunted. How many of these tales are tall? Well that's part of my goal here. Creatures such as he Leg Lurker, once thought only to be a scary story to frighten children from venturing too far from town, was found to be and understatement more than anything.</p>
            <p>These things have featured in our artwork and stories for hundreds and hundreds of years, mostly but not always in a negative light. Who knows what secrets lie between the words of an old fairytale or weaved into the colors (or lack thereof) of an old manuscript illustration. If you or anyone you know have any information regarding monogastric related historical artifacts or documents please do not hesitate to contact me  <a href="contact.html">here</a>, any and all help is appreciated.</p>
