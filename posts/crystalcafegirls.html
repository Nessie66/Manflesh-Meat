        <h1>CRYSTAL CAFE GIRLS</h1>
        <p>awesome drawings done by people and how they see themselves and such from <a href="https://crystal.cafe">crystal.cafe </a>DO NOT GO THERE THIS IS AN FBI TRACKED LINK but cool drawings yeah yeah. I wish i sat on my bed, teeth bared. But my teeth arent sharp enough.. so what'd be the point...</p>
        <p>in one of the drawings there are labels pointing out all sorts of  'flaws' like a 'big forehead', 'broad shoulders' and a 'big ugly nose' but, arguably, none of these are depicted interesting that she chose to specifically point these out in a self deprecating manner but not actually draw them... why.... .. modesty? insecurity??? she comes from a planet where everyone has tiny noses making hers massive by comparison!!?!?? who knows and/or cares. i like the artstyle and the pose.</p>
        <p>I would usually feel guilty arrogantly judging someone in this way but these are all from crystal cafe and therefore all likely to be self hating terfs so who cares honestly! (yes if you are evil im allowed to wrong you now lets not have a moral debate).</p>
