        <h2>Jason Molina + Magnolia Electric Co.</h2>

        <p>Jason Molina was a prolific musician mainly active throughout the
            late 90s and 2000s. He's realeased a lot of music under many different
            names with a revolving cast of talented musicians but his most well 
            known material was released as Songs:Ohia (later renamed to Magnolia Electric Co).

        <p>I don't know the full details of Jason's personal life so I won't get into
            it too much but he struggled with alcoholism for most of the decade after
            2003 which led to him cancelling tours in 2009 and eventually dying of
            multiple organ failiure on March 16th, 2013 at only 39 - supposedly with nothing
            but a cell phone in his pocket with only his grandmother's number on it.</p>

        <h3>Magnolia Electric Co.</h3>
        <img id="img3" src="img/itll_get_so_quiet_when_this_record_ends/Magnolia Electric Co..jpg">
        <p>In 2003 Songs:Ohia released (the) Magnolia Electric Co. which is one of my
            favorite albums ever, I love it dearly it means a lot to me. 
            It's not really like a lot of the other music I listen
            to, being a sort of indie rock/alternative country album.
            It's a really huge sounding record with a full  
            band behind it but despite this it manages to be very personal, with Jason staying 
            firmly at the center of it all. His powerful lyricism and dynamic vocals manage 
            to make it feel incredibly intimate and impactful.</p>

        <p>I'm not a fan of the common phrase "I like all music except country", maybe it's
            different for americans growing up around that sort of music but
            i've personally never had much of a problem with it (not that i would
            consider myself a massive country music fan). I think this
            album is a perfect example of how the sounds of country music like slide
            guitars, slapback delay, chord organs and twangy country vocals can be 
            incredibly emotional and create a familiar yet tragic atmosphere when used
            right. After hearing this record initially I was compelled to go out and
            buy a glass slide - which I broke and cut my foot on.
        </p>
        <h3>Songs</h3>
        <p>Every song on this is great so its hard to single out any but i did
            it anyway for convinience.
        </p>
        <h4>Farewell Transmission</h4>
        <p>Probably Songs:Ohia's most well known song. It opens with a relaxing and understated (but iconic)
            guitar riff with a restrained drumline plodding alongside it. But just as
            you think you know what you're in for the song suddenly opens up. It has a lot of momentum to it and it
            feels like its going somewhere, which I really like in music. The next 7 minutes feel like
            you're going on a sort of journey which culminates in one of my favorite song closing
            ever. Also the slide guitar all over is heavenly.
        </p>
        <h4>Just Be Simple</h4>
        <p>Probably one of the more country sounding songs on the album (other than The Old Black Hen).
            The lyricism on this one is probably some of my favorite on the whole album. The song feels
            resigned, like relapsing back into a bad habit or something. It ends whith Jasons plea for
            life to "Just be simple again" followed by a hearwrenching slide guitar.
        </p>
        <h4>Almost Was Good Enough</h4>
        <p>One of the louder songs on the album, it has these two overdriven twangy guitars
            sort of creating an atmosphere on either side while an organ of some kind pulls you
            along. It's hard to explain what makes this song so impactful but Jasons wails of
            "Almost no one makes it out" along with the general tone make it feel very tragic.
        </p>
        <h4>Hold On Magnolia</h4>
        <p>Easily the most hearbreaking song on the album. It's a slow and grim ballad drenched in an atmosphere of surrender and it
            really pulls you under. The song briefly rises up at the end only to settle back down as if its accepting its fate or something.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite song is probably The Big Game is Every Night. Though technically a bonus track, it sort 
            of feels like the antithesis to Farewell Transmission - the fairly upbeat song that opened the album.
            It's quite long at 9 minutes but like most of the tracks on the album it sort of sucks you into it.
            It feels grand, like Farewell Transmission, but in a dark and opressive way and this is reflected in the
            lyrics as well.

            <h4>Jason Molina is an incredible lyricist and here are some of my favorite lines from this album:</h4>
            <p>I will resurrect it, I'll have a good go at it<br>
                I'll streak his blood across my beak<br>
                Dust my feathers with his ash<br>
                I can feel his ghost breathing down my back<br>
                <br>
                (Farewell Transmission)
            </p>

            <p>You'll never hear me talk about one day getting out<br>
                Why put a new address on the same old loneliness<br>
                <br>
                And everything you hated me forâ€¦<br>
                Honey, there was so much more<br>
                I just didn't get busted<br>
                <br>
                (Just Be Simple)
            </p>

            <p>It'll get so quiet when this record ends<br>
                You can hear the first hour of the world<br>
                You can hear the willow branches touch the wave<br>
                Write our names beside our darlings hearts<br>
                <br>
                I am the snake, they're all saying<br>
                If they look up here, do they see just my black tail swaying?<br>
                If I'm all fangs, and all lies, and all poison<br>
                If I'm really what they're saying<br>
                I don't want to disappoint them<br>
                <br>
                (The Big Game is Every Night)</p>
