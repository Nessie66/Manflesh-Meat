                    <p>The Leg Lurker was a great and monstrous thing that stalked our lands for over 2000 years. While no officially photography exists, only drawings and paintings, it was described to be 'as big as a bus or a plane, somewhere in between the two'. It had three draconic heads each attached to a writhing long neck, and it had long spiked claws and a broad chest which it would beat before battle. Despite it's large size it was able to frequently catch travellers off guard and either devour them or melt them with it's poison saliva.</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>Sightings of the beast date back 2000 years with the earliest mention thought to be the legend of Rus Runk who drove a "great and ugly beast with multiple vicious poison spitting heads" back into a murky bog outside town. Since then it has appeared in many a myth and many a legend, usually as an evil antagonistic figurehead of the monogastric.</p>
                    <p>Verified encounters have been sparse throughout time, the most famous of which is Gizmo Dyers' in 1992. He lead a small militia up the hill to where the Leg Lurker had supposedly made its lair. The ensuing battle was hard fought and many, including Gizmo, were injured. Eventually, as you likely are aware, Coaxial Max sacrificed himself in a fibre optic flash. The beasts 3 heads were severed and the day was saved but Coaxial Max was dragged down with one of the heads deep into the earth, may he rest in pits. No-one truly understands how Coaxial Max was able to defeat the Leg Lurker that day.</p>
                    <p>Despite the defeat of the Leg Lurker, it endures as a popular cultural figure and it's image is often used in iconography related to anything Monogastric.</p>

                    <p>Of the three heads that were decapitated that day, only one was recovered. The other two reportedly fell back down into the Leg Lurkers pit and have never been found.</p>
