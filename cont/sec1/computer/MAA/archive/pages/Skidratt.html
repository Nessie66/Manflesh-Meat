                    <p>Skidratt is an unconfirmed entity theorized to have escaped during the 2005 MMC-Skunkworks incident. It is said to be a dire and disgusting attempt to fuse monogastric and multigastric DNA, namely, that of a rat and a wolf. It's common knowledge that wolves devour and devour and never shatter a single fang. As far as i'm aware.</p>
                    <p>MMC denies the existence of this entity and so we have little to go off, other than the testimony of ex-Skunkworks employees (where we get the colloquial name Skidratt.)</p>
                    <h3 class="">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>Many don't believe in Skidratt, thinking it to be a conspiracy theory. Others passionately attempt to prove it's existence. </p>
                    <p>There have been no confirmed sightings, but there are countless examples of enthusiasts claiming to have seen the beast. Not much else is known except that it may be dangerous.</p>
