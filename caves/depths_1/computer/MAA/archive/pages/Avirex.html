                    <h3 class="s1">Description</h3>
                    <p>Avirex is the designation given to a peculiar figure found below the surface. He appears with a dragon shaped head and thin gangly limbs. He is known to be capable of human communication and is described as being 'calm', 'passive' and 'a bit of a downer'. He was found residing in the upper levels of the caves, not much else is known about him or his origins.</p>
                    <h3 class="s2">History/Sightings</h3>
                    <p>He was first discovered during G.D's 1997 underground exploration of the caves. In the expedition logs he is described as being 'calm', 'passive, and ' a bit of a downer'. The log mentions a brief conversation took place from which we got the name 'Avirex'. The rest of this conversation, however, was not recorded and has been lost. He was encountered both on the way down and on the way back up and the log mentions that he 'hadn't moved an inch the whole time'. He was left unharmed by the expedition, as there isn't much you can do to a creature thats already buried. Although, it's safe to assume that if an ORG had been present he would've been mulched up on the spot!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="s2">We also believe that this creature might've been sighted above ground as early as 1993, shortly following the defeat of the Leg Lurker. This photograph was taken by a local man foraging for mushrooms in the woods by the edge of town. Whether or not this depicts Avirex or another creature is still up for debate.</p>

                    <p>The hunter mentions the creature looked 'sort of dazed' and that it quickly fled once it heard him.</p>
