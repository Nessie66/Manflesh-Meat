            FOR BEING A LOSER WITH

    <div id="c2" class="content">
        <p>in an image below there are labels pointing out all sorts of 
            'flaws' like a 'big forehead', 'broad shoulders' and a 'big 
            ugly nose' but, arguably, none of these are depicted!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>interesting that she chose to specifically point these out but 
            not actually draw them... why.... .. modesty? massive 
            insecurity meaning she preemptively levies criticism against 
            herself, yet is even insecure beyond this to the point that 
            she cant actually depict these features lest strangers on the 
            internet think shes ugly?!?? she drew this on opposite day!!?!??
             who knows and/or cares! i just like 
            the artstyle and the pose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I would usually feel guilty arrogantly judging someone in this 
            way but these are all crystal cafe dwellers, and therefore 
            all likely to be self hating terfs so who cares honestly! 
            (yes if you are evil im allowed to wrong you now lets not 
            have a moral debate (unless ur like evil in a flesh eating 
            kind of way (contact me if this is you))) . i wonder what 
            role self hatred plays in becoming an isolated internet terf, 
            probably a big one among many other complicated factors... 
            LIKE BEING A BIG BORING LOSER HAHAhHAHA!!</p>
